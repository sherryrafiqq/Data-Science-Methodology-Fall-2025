## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a *data analysis and visualization* adventure exploring Airbnb listings in NYC.

### 🔍 What We Did
✔ *Exploratory Data Analysis & Cleaning* – Because raw data can be messy! 🧹
✔ *Searchable Heat Map* – Find out which neighborhoods keep showing up! 🔥
✔ *Cluster Map* – Visualizing average rental prices for NYC boroughs 🗺
✔ *Horizontal Bar Plot* – Showcasing the highest-rated neighborhoods ⭐
✔ *Line Chart* – Analyzing the trend between construction year & total price 🏗
✔ *Bar Plot* – Room type vs. availability (365 days) 🏠📆
✔ *Bar Plot* – Listing rate out of 5 & host identity status (verified vs. unverified) ✅❌
✔ *Boxplot* – Instant bookability vs. total price 📦💲
